 Detection in Smart Grid 
 The smart grid is an advanced electrical power system that
 integrates modern communications and information technolo
gies to optimize the generation, distribution, and consumption
 of electricity. Integration of smart grid technology into the
 power industry has revolutionized the way we generate,
 transmit, and consume energy. Increasing adoption of smart
 grids has brought about numerous benefits for the power
 sector, such as improved efficiency, reliability, connectivity,
 and integration of renewable energy sources .Smartgrid
 technology has additional benefits such as improved demand
 response, cost savings, better customer involvement, lower
 CO2 emissions, and integration of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles[2]->Command Injection Attacks in
